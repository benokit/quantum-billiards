# quantum_billiards
Methods for computation and visualisation of spectra and wave functions of quantum billiards.
In order tu use the much faster parallelized cython versions of the basis functions run:

python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

from the src folder.

The main functionality includes:
- computation of billiard spectra
- computation and visualisation of billiard wavefunctions
- computation and visualisation of billiard Poincare-Husimi functions

Usage examples are provided in the examples folder.
